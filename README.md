This package consists of an custom built JSON
parser to read and clean tweets as well as
create a dynamically updated hashtag graph.
The program is capable of reading JSON tweets
from a dynamically updated "tweets.txt" file 
from the "tweet_input" directory and outputs 
cleaned tweets to the "ft1.txt" and the rolling 
degree of the hastag graph to the "ft2.txt" 
files in the "tweet_output" directory.
